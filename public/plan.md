An app for global crisis information would have a streamlined user interface centered around a map. The user journey would start with an overview and then allow for deep dives into specific crises and ways to help. üó∫Ô∏è

### **1\. Home Page / Global Map**

This is the core of the app. It's the first thing users see and the primary tool for navigation.

* **Functionality:**  
  * **Interactive Map:** A world map displaying markers at the locations of major crises (wars, natural disasters, humanitarian crises). Different icons or colors could be used to distinguish the type of crisis.  
  * **Filter/Search:** A search bar or filter menu that lets users find specific crises by name, country, or type (e.g., "earthquake," "conflict").  
  * **Basic Data Display:** A small information panel that shows a quick headline and the number of active crises globally or in a specific region, updating in real-time.  
* **Initial State:** The app opens to this page. The map is the main visual element.

### **2\. Crisis Detail Page**

When a user taps a marker on the map, this page provides a comprehensive overview of that specific crisis.

* **Functionality:**  
  * **Summary:** A concise, easy-to-read summary of the crisis, including its history, current status, and key facts.  
  * **Statistics:** Display important metrics like the number of people affected, displaced, or in need of aid.  
  * **News Feed:** A curated feed of verified news articles and reports from reputable sources (e.g., UN, Red Cross, major news outlets) to provide up-to-date information.  
  * **Visuals:** A carousel or gallery of relevant photos, infographics, and short videos to humanize the data.

### **3\. Take Action Page**

This page is the call to action, providing users with tangible ways to make a difference. It's the crucial step that connects information to impact.

* **Functionality:**  
  * **Donation Links:** A list of vetted, reputable non-profit organizations and charities actively working on the ground for that specific crisis. Each entry would include a short description of the organization and a direct link to their donation page.  
  * **Petition/Advocacy:** Links to relevant petitions, government contact information, or other advocacy campaigns.  
  * **Local Initiatives:** For crises with a global reach, this section could highlight local chapters or groups that users can join to help raise awareness or funds in their own community.  
      
  * Can create your own volunteer listings, there will be another map that is much more local, on this map it shows where you can volunteer, and lets you add events and have them appear on the local map so other people can see.

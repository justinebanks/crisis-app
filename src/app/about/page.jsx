                            Crisis is a global platform built to inform, connect, and empower people in the face of the world's most pressing challenges, both large and small. While international crises such as wars, earthquakes, and humanitarian emergencies often dominate headlines, countless smaller struggles affect communities every day yet receive little to no attention. Crisis was created to change that.

                        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                            At the heart of the platform is an interactive world map that allows users to explore crises of all scales. From large-scale disasters to localized events, whether it's flooding in Florida, a wildfire in a rural town, or a humanitarian emergency overseas, Crisis provides a clear, real-time overview of what is happening and why it matters. Users can filter by region or type of event, dive into detailed crisis profiles with historical and current information, and access statistics, verified news, and multimedia resources that bring each story to life.

                        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                            What makes Crisis unique is its commitment to inclusivity and visibility. In addition to tracking global emergencies, the platform is designed to highlight smaller, community-level crises that often go unnoticed. Through a crisis submission feature, individuals and organizations can bring attention to issues in their own communities, ensuring that overlooked problems—whether local environmental hazards, public health concerns, or grassroots social struggles—are visible on a global stage.

                            Crisis also provides a way for users to take direct action. Beyond its main crisis map, the platform includes a dedicated volunteer map, a more localized view that connects people to opportunities for change in their own areas. Users can create and share volunteer listings, organize events, and have them appear on the local map so others can join or contribute.
                        </p>

                            From cleanup projects and donation drives to advocacy events and relief missions, this feature makes it easy for people to move from awareness to impact within their own communities. Each crisis profile includes vetted ways to help, from donating to reputable organizations, to signing petitions, to joining local volunteer initiatives.

                                At Crisis, our mission is to make every crisis, big or small, visible, understandable, and actionable.

                                We believe that meaningful change begins with awareness, but awareness must extend beyond the global stage. While large-scale conflicts and disasters demand urgent attention, smaller, localized crises are just as critical to the people they affect. Crisis exists to shine light on both, ensuring that no problem is too small to matter.
